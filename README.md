## What is Nightcore?
Nightcore is an artist from Norway that, in 2002, released albums of dance tracks with elevated pitch and tempo. Due to its wonderfulness, ease of production and the advent of YouTube, these style tracks slowly gained popularity. Today, **nightcore is a music metagenreâ€”any song whose pitch and tempo has been raised**, often along with an anime image and almost excusively distributed through YouTube.

Here's an example: [Nightcore - Everytime We Touch [Cascada]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0FeXmgEXaU)
